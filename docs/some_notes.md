Clothesline Saga as appearing in BS11 has been marked [`clos_t2`][clos_t2] despite the absence of a take 1 `clos_t1` in BS11, due to the existence of a short "false start" take present in @@@, which has been labelled `clos_t1`. In some albums both takes are present in a single track, thus `clos_t1-2` indicates the latter.

Ain't No More Cane version by The Band has been marked as `anmc_t3`.

Instrumental (#1) has been titled "Organ Riffs" (Griffin 243), only FTR  correctly marked it as such.

900 Miles from my home has been marked as `9mfmh_t2` for the long version appearing on BS11, whereas the short appearing in multiple bootlegs has been labelled `9mfmh_t1` following Griffin (144-146).

"I can't come in with a broken heart" in BS11 is one single file, and also Griffin lists one single take, despite the song being split into two parts in several bootlegs; the parts have been marked as `icciwabh_s1` and `icciwabh_s2`.

"Waltzin' with sin" in BS11 is one single file, and also Griffin lists one single take, despite the song being split into two parts in several bootlegs; the parts have been marked as `wws_s1` and `wws_s2`.

[`cb`][#cb] d07t21 is labelled, reported in the artwork, and detailed in the included original info file as "Nothing was delivered (take 1)" [`nwd_t1`][#nwd_t1] but contains "Too much of nothing (take 2)" [`tmon_t2`][#tmon_t2]. I cannot verify if this is a flaw of my copy alone.
