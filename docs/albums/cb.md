[Lossless Bob LB-1979](http://www.losslessbob.wonderingwhattochoose.com/detail/LB-01979.html)

## Notes
Only Bob Dylan and The Band tracks are taken into account for analysis; cover versions are excluded.

## Description (from original info file)
Well, here is it, my third attempt to cover the Basement Recordings. This attempt is more of an 'Anthology' than simply the 'Dylan Basement recordings'.

I've used filler from 'influences' or 'originals' of most of the songs covered in the first 4 reels. I could be wrong, but it seems reasonable to suppose that Dylan and the Band were listening to recordings of Ian & Sylvia, Hank Williams & Johnny Cash and others, so these songs have been added. For me these songs add depth to the early sessions.
I was unable to locate any versions of: Baby Ain't that Fine (Frazier), No Shoes on my Feet (trad) - Cisco Huston (as Going Down the Road), Johnny Todd (trad), One Man's Loss, One Single River(Tyson / Fricker), Silhouettes (Slay / Crew), The Spanish Song (aka Amelita, Luisa, Carmelita) & Waltzing with Sin (Hayes / Burns).

I want to thank Randy for helping me locate many of the originals I used.

For the Reels 5-7 disk I have swapped the channels on about half of the recordings to be consistent with the details in Helyin's book - The Recording Sessions.

For Disk 7, I've retained the original 14 track acetate as the main tape, and simply filled up that disk with the additional alternate takes and the additional Publishers Demos (Big Ben). These recordings are noticaly differently mixed to the Reel versions.

I've also added a full CD of contemporary cover versions (Disk 8). I felt that as this was how we first came to hear these songs, they deserved to have a CD in their own right.
There were others I remembered (such as PPM - Too Much of Nothing), that I didn't have room to add. There are various detailed accounts of how these 60s-70s groups and artists came to hear and learn these songs, that are worth checking out.

Using my source tape I have remastered the recordings used for Disk 9 again, to remove the effects of 'noise reduction' apparent on my original attempt.
