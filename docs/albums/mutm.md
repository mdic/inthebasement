## Description ([source](http://www.losslessbob.wonderingwhattochoose.com/detail/LB-11057.html))

### from original info file

Liberated Hollow Horn bootleg
Excellent quality, vastly superior to everything that has come before

The legendary Basement Tapes Safety Master was a tape reportedly made by Garth Hudson in early 1968 of the best available original master tapes made in the summer of 1967. This safety tape features truly breathtaking sound quality and also, in the majority of cases, features the material in its original glorious stereo.
