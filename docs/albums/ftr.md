## Description ([source](https://theband.hiof.no/albums/boot_from_the_reels_complete_basements.html))

**Note**:*the version documented at [https://theband.hiof.no/albums/boot_from_the_reels_complete_basements.html](https://theband.hiof.no/albums/boot_from_the_reels_complete_basements.html) has slight variations from the one used here, both in terms of tracks order and artwork. I do not remember where I have found this version back in the early 2000s.*

 11 CD Dylan & The Hawks/Band bootleg set from 2001. It was originally a 10 disc set. Disc 11 was added later by someone else for some reason. There's a lot of repetition of tracks.

 > Here is the concept of the original 10CD set. The order on the GBT series is unsatisfactory (and the way the bootleggers missed out Band tracks and even one Dylan track), and I preferred the order on the original tapes. Of course the order on the tapes is not the reel order either so with the help of Invisible Republic / Heylin it is possible to work out a very rough reel order. It got too hard for reels 5-7 so they are just lumped together (these are the mostly original basement tracks anyway, and they sit nicely together). As you all know the details of the reels is sketchy at best, so at times just rough 74min groupings are used. An overriding principle was to preserve the reel order. Somewhere along the line it was realised that the 'historical artifacts' associated with the Basements were not represented, so the 14 song Acetate disk needed to be added. Then of course the alternate takes were not represented either, so the '20 song Acetate disk' was added . I know that this completly duplicated the '14 song Acetate', but the 14 song one was the acetate that was very special, and deserved a disk in it's own right!. The Publisher's demos were different again. Different tracks and different mixes. So these were added to this set as well. Finally, there were all those 'mostly Band' tracks that had emerged over the years, so they are just assembled onto a misc CD (#10).  In the time since this 'fan project' was completed, there have been a couple of other 'Basement' releases, one a 5 CDR set, nice quality, but lacking many tracks (..almost nothing from reel 1) emerged, and more recently the 4CD 'Tree with Roots' emerged. These have been carefully compared as well, and where appropriate, tracks were upgraded to the original 10CD set.  Recently, someone else seems to have gotten hold of this set and and thinks that there were some other missing tracks (I'm not particually convinced that reel 11 contains any new basement tracks at all...) and added these tracks to reel #11.
