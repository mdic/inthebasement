## Description ([source](https://theband.hiof.no/albums/boot_down_in_the_basement.html))

The songs on this bootleg are mostly taken from Garth Hudson's legendary Basement Tapes, recorded in the Big Pink, Woodstock, West Saugerties, New York, April-October 1967. Also included are the four songs "I Got You Babe," "Memphis, TN," "Sonny Boy" and "Be My Baby", recorded with falsetto singer Tiny Tin backed by the Band/Hawks for the soundtrack of Peter Yarrow's movie You Are What You Eat. The album has 10 "proper" tunes and 6 instrumental "interludes". All of the instrumentals list Robbie Robertson as composer (except "Piano Rag" which is listed as traditional). The Tiny Tim recordings were generally available on the mid-80's bootleg Blind Boy Grunt and the Hawks Basement Tapes, a 4 LP set which was the first of the really great basement bootlegs.
