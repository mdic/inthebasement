# In the Basement

_do do do do do do... bash!_

This website was born out of the curiosity to investigate the various _Basement Tapes_ versions I have collected over the past 25 years or so.  
I am no sound engineer nor audio expert, but I like to find out how things work and; and with the help of some Python, I set up a [custom mini-application](./how.md) to gather technical details about each and every track in [11 different albums](./albums/index.md) containing recordings from the _Basement Tapes_.  


!!! important
    This website does not contain any audio file, nor any link to audio files.  
    And don't ask me where to find them.
